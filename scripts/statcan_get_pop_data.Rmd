## Data

### by CD

"CD" == "Census Division" == BC Regional District (the other provinces have different administrative regions that align with CDs)


Population estimates, July 1, by census division, 2016 boundaries1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Frequency: Annual

Table: 17-10-0139-01

Release date: 2023-01-11

Geography: Canada, Province or territory, Census division

```{r}

#pop_cd <- get_cansim("17-10-0139-01")

write_rds(pop_cd, "pop_cd.rds")
```

#### apply filters

```{r}
# BC total population
pop_cd %>% 
  filter(GEO == "British Columbia") %>% 
  filter(Sex == "Both sexes" &
           `Age group` == "All ages")

# Vancouver Island CDs 
pop_cd_vi <- pop_cd %>%
  #filter(str_detect(GeoUID, "59\\d\\d")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(GeoUID, "^59")) %>%
  filter(Sex == "Both sexes" &
           `Age group` == "All ages") %>% 
  
  # filter for Vancouver Island
  # create separate variable with just the CD number
  mutate(geo_cd = as.character(str_sub(GeoUID, start = 3, end = 4)))  %>% 
  filter(geo_cd %in% vi_cd_list)
  
pop_cd_vi

```

clean up Regional District names 

* split into regional district name and province columns

```{r}
# split GEO into regional district and province
pop_cd_vi <- pop_cd_vi %>% 
  tidyr::separate_wider_delim(GEO, delim = ", ", names = c("regional_district", "province"))

pop_cd_vi

```


```{r}
# remove unnecessary columns, put into wide format
pop_cd_vi_wide <- pop_cd_vi %>% 
  select(
    REF_DATE, 
    regional_district, 
    GeoUID,
    VALUE
    ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = REF_DATE, values_from = VALUE)

pop_cd_vi_wide

```



### by CSD

CDs are divided into CSDs

"CSD" == "Census Sub-Division" == Municipality, formal Indian Reserves and other First Nation lands, & other unincorporated rural areas (in BC, known as Regional District Electoral Areas)
